# Classical-Chinese-Dataset-WebCrawler

This program is to gather the valuable Classical Chinese text data from the web using web-crawler in python3.  By now it has the following data to be use (since it‘s too heavy to upload all them on github, I only upload two samples of them each for a dataset, you could get all the data by clicking their name):
* [Twenty-four Histories (二十四史)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HftMMfUQZheoH3P56_-ij1864gwdsjsI)

To run my code, you need these  package prerequsities: 
* Beautifulsoup
* requests
